# Stock Prediction Application

## Installation
This installation will be used in a linux environment. You can do this through the student server, if you have an account connect to [yourname]@student.cs.uni.edu through an ssh shell.

Or this can be done having a virtualbox running ubuntu 18.04(preferred), a guide can be shown here:

This can still be done other ways, for our project we had a private virtual linux server, similar to the student server.  

### Initialize Git repository
Make a directory on the linux server you are using: `mkdir application`
